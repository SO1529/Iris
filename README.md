# Iris
The Iris Dataset consists of four features—sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width—collected from 50 samples each of three Iris species: Iris setosa, Iris virginica, and Iris versicolor. These features are used to build a linear discriminant model for classifying the species based on their physical characteristics.
